Decentralized voting application based on previously deployed Token and Tokenized Ballot contracts.

- **Token contract**: 0x9805944Da4F69978dffc4c02eA924911D668d81a
- **Tokenized Ballot contract**: 0x86194b8C24DB66Ef9ACFA70b4c2fc837F0684961

The dApp displays information about the connected wallet (token balance, number of votes, etc) and allows some interactions with the deployed contracts such as querying and writing to them.

This was implemented using React on the frontend and NodeJS API (Swagger) using NestJS framework to create the backend API requests.

## Setup:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` within `frontend` and `backend` folders.
3. For the backend run `npm run start`.
4. For the frontend run `npm run dev`.
5. Configure environment variables as necessary.
